# Green Spark Submission

## Project Title
ReSpark

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

## Project Overview
ReSpark is a technology solution designed to fundamentally shift consumer behavior from a disposable mindset to a circular one. Instead of just locating recycling bins, our application incentivizes and gamifies the acts of **Repair** and **Reuse** for electronic items, tackling the e-waste problem at its source.

Through a clean, habit-tracking interface, users log their aging electronics, earn "Spark Points" for extending product life, and redeem those points for tangible rewards at local businesses. This "pre-cycling" approach creates a virtuous cycle: users save money, local businesses gain customers, and our community becomes measurably cleaner.

## Key Features
- **Pre-Cycling Gamification:** A unique rewards system that grants the most points for repairing or reusing an item, explicitly teaching and encouraging users to prioritize these actions over recycling.

- **"Second-Life" Habit Tracker:** A visual timer that awards users daily points for every day an item is kept functional and out of a landfill, turning waste prevention into an engaging, long-term habit.

- **Repair-First Mapping:** An intelligent, interactive map that defaults to showing local repair shops and community swap events, positioning recycling as a final option rather than the default choice.

## Additional Notes

### Technology & MVP Strategy
Our development process was guided by a single principle: **deliver a polished, functional proof-of-concept.**

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS
- **Mapping Service:** Leaflet.js
- **Data Storage:** Browser `localStorage`
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### Future Vision & Scalability
ReSpark is designed for growth. Our roadmap focuses on evolving the MVP into a full-scale platform.
